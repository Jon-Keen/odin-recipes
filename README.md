# odin-recipes

This is my first attempt at building the "odin-recipes" lesson on The Odin Project.
By the end of this tutorial I will showcase basic HTML. I should have a working html boilerplate and add an h1 heading "Odin Recipes" to index.html.
I will create multiple directories and create links to those folders for different recipes. Each page will contain h1 headings with what they are, also containing recipes for each dish.
