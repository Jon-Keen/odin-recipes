# odin-recipes

This is my first attempt at building the "odin-recipes" lesson on The Odin Project.
By the end of this tutorial I will showcase basic HTML. I should have a working html boilerplate and add an h1 heading "Odin Recipes" to index.html.
I will create multiple directories and create links to those folders for different recipes. Each recipe page will contain h1 headings with the dish name and paragraphs of the recipe contents and instructions.
